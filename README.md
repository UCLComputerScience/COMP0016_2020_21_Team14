Arthur Murray is an international dance academy, named after the renowned, world-famous dancer. Working alongside Arthur Murray Dance Academy in Coral Gables,
we developed a dance content platform for students of the academy to progress in their curriculum. This platform consists of a content management system (CMS),
through which instructors can distribute dance content, and an iOS application, through which students can view dance routines and progress in their curriculum.
The CMS was built using WordPress and the iOS application was developed in React Native. The two components work together to provide synchronous updates of
content on both platforms. The CMS and iOS application are fully functional and can be deployed on the client’s system.
